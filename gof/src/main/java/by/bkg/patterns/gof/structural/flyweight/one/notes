Create set of "heavy" objects (take much time to create or many resources to store).
These objects have set of "unique" (extrinsic, they are mutable) and "repeating" (intrinsic, they are immutable) properties.
Basing on this object -- some actions might be done (e.g., in current code example, Shape instances store information about shape to be drawn. Once drawn -- Shape object might be updated for next drawing)

Probable other example -- messaging (but in single-thread app only). Message is FlyWeight object. Create message and send it.

SIDE EFFECT here: some kind of pipe is needed. I.e. "create Shape 1 -> draw Shape 1 -> create Shape 2 -> draw Shape 2".
Cannot "create Shape 1 -> create Shape 2 -> draw Shape 1 -> draw Shape 2"
